  The Collector's internal telemetry logger now supports optional log file rotation using the lumberjack library.
  Configure `rotation` settings (max size, age, backups, compression) to manage log growth and retention directly, without needing external tools like logrotate.
  Applies rotation only if a valid file-based `output_paths` entry is provided.
  If `rotation.enabled` is false or the block is omitted, log behavior remains unchanged.
  Only affects file-based logging; no impact on default console targets like stdout, stderr logging or console environments.

# Optional: The change log or logs in which this entry should be included.
# e.g. '[user]' or '[user, api]'
# Include 'user' if the change is relevant to end users.
# Include 'api' if there is a change to a library API.
# Default: '[user]'
